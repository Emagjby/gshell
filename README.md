# gshell

Minimal shell project written in C. This was my first C project, built to understand the language and I got solid hands-on experience from it. It is not a commercial project and serves mainly as a learning reference.

## Status
- Experimental learning project
- Not intended for production use yet
- Planned rewrite in Rust as v2 to make it a usable shell

## Installation
```sh
make install
```

## Usage
```sh
gshell
```
